`hakyll-images` is suite of utilities to deal with images in the context of [Hakyll](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll).

`hakyll-images`, at this time, allows to compress JPEG images by re-encoding them at a lower quality. Further features are planned, namely image-resizing and image-scaling.
