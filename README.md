# Laurent's personal site ![GH-Pages](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/personal-website/workflows/GH-Pages/badge.svg)

Welcome to the source code to my personal site. This repository contains everything you need to replicate the site on your own machine, and learn how to make your own static website with Haskell 

This static website is generated using the following tools:

* [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static website generator library; 
* [Blaze](https://jaspervdj.be/blaze/), a Haskell HTML templating library; 
* [pandoc-plot](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-plot) to render figures directly from Markdown documents.

You can access the generated site at [https://laurentrdc.xyz](https://laurentrdc.xyz).
