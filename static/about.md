## Currently
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Physics department](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca) at McGill University. I work in a small team led by Bradley J. Siwick at the forefront of ultrafast condensed matter physics. Our main tool is a RF-compressed ultrafast electron diffractometer. You can learn more about our team on our [group website](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/siwicklab/index.html).
