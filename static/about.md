## Volunteering

* August 2022 - | [__Haskell Foundation__](https://haskell.foundation/) | Technical Working Group member

    The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group discusses [community proposals](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/PROPOSALS.md) based on their potential positive impact on the whole Haskell community.

    While I'm interested in all technical aspects brought forth by the Haskell community, I'm keeping an eye on proposals related to my personal expertise: high-performance scientific computing, data science, and machine learning.
