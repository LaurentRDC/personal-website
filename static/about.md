## Volunteering

* August 2022 - Jan 2024 | [__Haskell Foundation__](https://haskell.foundation/) | Technical Working Group member

    The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group discusses [community proposals](https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/PROPOSALS.md) based on their potential positive impact on the whole Haskell community.

    While I was interested in all technical aspects brought forth by the Haskell community, I was keeping an eye on proposals related to my personal expertise: high-performance scientific computing, data science, and machine learning.
    
    <p></p>

* May 2023 - Nov 2023 | [__Haskell Summer of Code__](https://summer.haskell.org/) | Mentor

    Haskell Summer of Code is a program to encourage students to contribute to the Haskell community by proposing ideas and implementing them over a summer.

    I mentored a student focused on decoupling the standard Haskell documentation tool, [Haddock](https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/), from the internals of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
