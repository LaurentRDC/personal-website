## Computer Science and Software Engineering <a name="software"></a>

<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> | [Haskell At Work](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUgxpaK7ySR-z6AXA5-uDuw)

Wonderful live-coding sessions (~10min) showcasing Haskell features.

<i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> | [What I wish I know when learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/)

Collection of tips and tricks on using Haskell

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> | [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)

This book is a double-feature : introduction to programming __and__ learning Haskell at the same time. Long read (~1200 pages) and yet it only scratches the surface!

<i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> | [Functional Data Structures](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/flaneries/FDS/)

University-level introductory class to data structures and algorithms in the context of functional programming, from the legendary Computer Science department at University of Waterloo. I admit I have not read this thorougly. I am keeping a link to it here for future reference.

<i class="fas fa-rss"></i> | [Tweak I/O Blog](https://www.tweag.io/blog)

Very technical discussions regarding Haskell.

## General science <a name="science"></a>

<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> | [Mechanical Fourier Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg&list=PL0INsTTU1k2UYO9Mck-i5HNqGNW5AeEwq)

This YouTube playlist explains how the Michelson Harmonic Analyzer works. This machine was used by Albert Michelson to speed up his work in Fourier transform spectroscpy __100 years ago__.

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> | [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)

I have the three volumes, and they were a joy to go through when studying for the PhD preliminary examination (or qualifying examination). It turns out that the content is also freely available online directly from the publisher!

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> | [Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05374-9)

The link above actually points to a _book review_, and not to the book itself. However the premise is tentalizing. I might read it one day, and you probably should too.

## Video games <a name="vidya"></a>

<i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> | [Raycevick](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JTQBa5QxZCpXrFSkMxmPw)

Long-form video game analysis, in the form of video essays.

## Society <a name="society"></a>

<i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> | [Getting in](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in)

2005 essay on Ivy League admissions by Malcolm Gladwell.
