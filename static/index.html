            Welcome to my corner of the internet!
        </p>
        <p>
            To introduce myself: I thirst for knowledge and the wisdom to use it, 
            as it were. I live for "Eureka!" moments.

            In practical terms, I am interested in many domains, including natural 
            sciences, mathematics, computer science, deeptech innovation, climate technologies, 
            software correctness, energy infrastructure, and finance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of my day job, I write a lot of open-source software. I believe computers should 
            make my life easier, and therefore am immensely fond of purely functional programming. You
            can learn more about <a href="/software.html">projects I maintain</a>.
        </p>
        <p> You can find more details about <a href="/about.html">my credentials</a> and
            <a href="/index.html#recent-posts">my thoughts</a>.

            If you were looking to read more specifically about my scientific research, you can check
            out <a href="/publications.html">my publications</a>, or head over to the
