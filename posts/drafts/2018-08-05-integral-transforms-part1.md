title: The Beauty of Integral Transforms Part 1 - Prerequisites
---

This is the first part of a series concerning one of my favourite mathematical tools, integral transforms. The Fourier transform ubiquitous in many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, is a poster child for integral transforms, but it is far from the only one. 

In this series, I would like to explain the intuition behind integral transforms, with as little prior knowledge of mathematics as possible. I'm guessing high school calculus should be enough, but it is hard for me to estimate these things correctly.

## Vector spaces

We begin our journey with a mathematical structure called a _vector space_. If the last time you heard of vectors was high school, you might think that vectors are points (or arrows) in 2D/3D. These are __Euclidian vectors__, and they are not the only vectors we will play with here.

A vector space is a collection of objects together with a few operations you can do on them. The objects are called __vectors__. The basic operations on vectors are __addition__ (+) of two vectors and __scaling__ (or scalar multiplication) of a vector with a number.
