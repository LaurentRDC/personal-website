                    <p>In a recent all-hands meeting, management encouraged software engineers to use large language models to improve developer productivity.</p>
<p>The ensuing discussion was more nuanced than I expected. Management acknowledged that care must be taken to not send sensitive data to third parties such as OpenAI. We were encouraged to spin up our own, local, offline versions of open-weight models. There was also no illusion that large language models, as of writing these words, are not <em>competent</em> in any sense of the word, and as such their outputs must always be reviewed<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Despite these nuances, large language models are considered by my coworkers to be a net positive for software development.</p>
<p>I don’t share this excitement. I <em>don’t want</em> to involve large language models in my software development. I feel like an alien saying it out loud. This post is about my rationalization of why I don’t feel the need to evolve my software development workflow in this way, with a little metaphor on a past technological revolution whose blind adoption is causing many problems today.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have been writing software, professionally or otherwise, since 2015. I am usually in one of two possible situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know exactly what to do, and how to do it, and I simply need to execute;</li>
<li>I don’t know exactly what my goal is, and I’m trying to figure it out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Large language models, with their current lack of reasoning, are most useful in the first case. Example: I have to write a test for some database query logic. There are already many such tests in our codebase, and I could re-use a lot of the boilerplate, with minimal tweaking. Here, my productivity is limited by my ability to type quickly, and large language models could conceivable help.</p>
<p>I find myself in the second situation most of the time. And that is great news! I get to employ my creativity to hard solve problems. I am constantly juggling various possibilities, and making decisions on partial information. <a href="../../software.html">This is such a joy that I even do it at night for free</a>. In this state, my productivity is limited by my ability to <em>think</em>, not <em>type</em>. and large language models are of little help.</p>
<p>So, in practice, using large language models would have little effect on my productivity.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pedantic readers might have noticed that I left a gap in the description of my workflow. I’m also sometimes in a third state, a hybrid state where I know <em>what</em> do to, but not <em>how</em> to do it.</p>
<p>Suppose you asked me to build a simple application using <a href="https://www.purescript.org/">Purescript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/purescript-halogen/purescript-halogen">Halogen</a>. No amount of deep thinking is going to move me forward; I need to learn Purescript and Halogen, and that might be a slow process. Or, I could call on a large language model to basically do it for me, while I provide high-level guidance.</p>
<p>This is where I’m skeptical of the benefits of large language models. In such a situation, it would truly be more productive to enlist the help of large language models <em>in the short term</em>. But in the long term, this would be a crutch, a shaky foundation that prevents <em>long-term productivity</em>. For one-off tasks? I would consider using a large language model. But, honestly, I can’t recall the last time I had a true one-off task where I could completely side-step the need to wrap my brain around something.</p>
<p>As I am told by my network, this is already a major problem for the juniors currently learning how to program and getting their first job. By prioritizing short-term performance, they might lose on learning valuable skills as basic as reading documentation and reasoning about design tradeoffs. Software developers aren’t monkeys with typewriters; they are creative individuals evolving in a profession that sometimes has more to do with witchcraft than engineering, as it were.</p>
<hr />
<p>The contention between short-term productivity against long-term productivity brings us to a metaphor, one that I think of almost every day: the democratization of the car over the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Over the past of the 125 years, the streets of major western cities went from being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894&amp;oldid=1247448911">overrun with horse manure</a> to being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_horse_manure_crisis_of_1894&amp;oldid=1247448911">overrun with car traffic</a>. The personal car has revolutionized personal transportation, allowing individuals to cross large distances, inaccessible by long-distance public transit such as trains (a problem which is particularly dire in my native Canada). After the second World War, the <a href="https://archup.net/city-density-and-automobile-impact/">culture of the car peaked in North America</a>, leading to new urbanism centered around access the car.</p>
<p>For many decades, the benefits of car culture were obvious, as it removed limitations on the basic problem of transporting people. But for some time, we have started to feel the downsides of this model – especially in cities. The housing crisis, high traffic congestion, the staggering number of traffic deaths, the destruction of the third place, the effectively mandatory access to a large expense: lots of people are sobering up from the “car everywhere!” mindset.</p>
<p>By fully embracing the dependency on a new technology, we can improve our lives, yes, but also make ourselves slaves to machines purportedly about giving us freedom. I’ll be fine – I can afford to live the way I want – but I worry for the next generation. You don’t <em>have</em> to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
