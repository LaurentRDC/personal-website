title: Design your own stealth aicraft using Yee's method

The idea here is to build software based on finite-difference time-domain (Yee's method), which allows to solve Maxwell's equations in time and space, to model the response of an aircraft to radar wave pulses.

Connect this to my experience using terahertz pulses.

Show the difference in response between basic shapes, culminating in the shape of the F-117 Nighthawk (which has a simple but effective shape)
