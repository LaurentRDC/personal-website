As you can see from this website, I am quite involved in the Haskell community. Well, I went a step further by applying to join, and then being elected to, the [Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation)'s [board of directors](https://haskell.foundation/who-we-are/).

[The Haskell Foundation is driven by a vision](https://haskell.foundation/vision/). Haskell has a rich history of academic research, innovation, and industry usage driven by strong principles. Within this vision, I personally want focus on boosting the community's health on two fronts.

The first front is **industry adoption**. I took a new Haskell-focused role this year, and Haskell's unique strengths -- as well as unique challenges -- are front-of-mind. The Haskell Foundation is ramping up efforts to spend resources on its technical agenda. If you use, or plan to use, Haskell in production, we would love to hear how we can help you (contact info at the end of this post).

The second front is the **successful conversion of Haskell curiousity to Haskell knowledge**, especially amongst experienced programmers. Over the years, I have spoken with many, *many* people whose curiosity, although intense, did not materialize into knowledge of Haskell. My own experience of learning and using Haskell was, and remains, a wonderful intellectual journey, and I want everyone to be able to experience the same thing. I'll have more to say about how we plan to tackle this in the next few months.

If any of these two challenges are of interest to you, do not hesitate to reach out to me at my new email ([laurent@haskell.foundation](mailto:laurent@haskell.foundation)).
