title: Making a concrete coffee table

This post will go through the process of making a concrete coffee table. I had never worked with concrete before. This was a relatively simple introduction to concrete furniture.

The objective was to make a coffee table out of concrete, using recycled materials as much as possible. Moreover, since concrete is easily shaped, I wanted to make an asymmetric table (i.e. not a rectangle). 

First, here's the final result:

Here it is 'installed' (on a wooden box I had lying around):

## Making the mould

Concrete tables are easiest to make using a _reverse cast_ method. We made a mould from a smooth material, __melamine boards__, that my dad found in the trash at his job. I first brainstormed what shape I wanted, then drew the shape on the main board:

Other melamine boards were cut into strips of about 1.5 inches wide. These would later make the sides of the mould. Here is the partially-assembled mould:

Note that since the table is asymmetric, some of the joints between strips are at small angles. We used a [Mitre saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miter_saw) to cut the end of strips. Here is an example:

We also pre-drilled the holes with a wider drill bit so that screws would not protrude from the strips, like so:

This will make it easier to level the concrete later on, as the surface of the strips will be flat.

Here is the assembled mould:

Note that at this points, joints are not water tight; concrete would slowly leak out. Here's an example joint:

We need to make the mould water-tight. Caulking was used for this purpose:

Here is the finished mould after cleaning:

## Concrete mix

I used two 80 lbs (~36 kg) bags of concrete mix. The idea was to mix all the concrete, then separate it in two batches : one left as-is, and the other batch colored with charcoal pigments. Then, recombine the two halves, without mixing too much, to create a marbled look. 

I mixed the concrete by hand(-held mixer) in this wheelbarrow:

Charcoal pigments mixed in water are waiting in a separate container:

Unfortunately I have no pictures showing the process before I recombined the two concrete halves. Here is the final mix. You can also see the tool I used to mix the concrete (handheld drill + concrete mixing attachment):

Note that while the mix seems uniform, I mixed the final concrete _very little_. At this point I thought I failed to do the marbling; as you will see, it actually worked. Also the mix looks brown; the color will change during hardening.

## Moulding

Here is the filled mould:

I have no pictures of this, but we added some metal rebar to help with structural integrity. 

We leveled the surface with another melamine strip. This is why we pre-drilled the holes, so that the entire mould + concrete assembly lays perfectly flat.

At this point, we needed to remove the air bubbles trapped in the concrete. This was done by hammering the underside of the mould with a rubber mallet for about an hour. Bubbles appeared at the surface like so:

<img src="/images/coffee-table/air-bubbles.jpg" style="width:500px;"/>

To help the concrete harden more uniformly, I 'sealed' the mould using plastic bags:

<img src="/images/coffee-table/sealed-mould.jpg" style="width:500px;"/>

Every few days, I would remove the plastic layer and spray water on the concrete surface.

## Initial hardening

After a week, the concrete is hard enough to partially de-mould. Here is the hardened surface (which will end up being the bottom of the table):

At least this is confirmation that the table is not _brown_. We flipped the table to expose the top surface. It's difficult to see on this image, but the surface looks like it might be marbled:

## Polishing and Finish

After about two weeks, I polished the surface (200-grit) to reveal the marbling.

_Before_:

_After_:

<img src="/images/coffee-table/after-polishing.jpg" style="width:500px;"/>

Looking closely, we can see air bubbles:

Note that if I was making a kitchen counter, I would want to get rid of the holes in the surface (for sanitary reasons); in my case I thought it was not important. However, I still tried to fill in some of the larger holes using a more liquid concrete mix:

<img src="/images/coffee-table/filling-holes.jpg" style="width:500px;"/>

After 24h, I polished the surface and sides again, with a smaller grit (400-grit):

<img src="/images/coffee-table/before-coating.jpg" style="width:500px;"/>

Finally, to protect the surface and make the marbling more visible, I coated the table with some wood varnish I found lying around at my parents'. I only have a picture of coating the underside of the table:

Transport from my parents' garage to my apartment:

Final coat of varnish at home:

## Closing comments

The final cost was about 85 CA dollars:

- 50 CA dollars for two bags of concrete and metal reinforcements;

- 35 CA dollars for iron oxide pigments (5kg);

- free melamine picked up from trash;

- free varnish from what should have been thrown away;

- free man-hours over the course of a few months.

Thanks to my father for all the help.
