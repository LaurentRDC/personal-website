<p>In this post, I’ll show you a class of filtering technique, based on discrete wavelet transforms, which is suited to noise that cannot be filtered away with more traditional techniques – such as ones that rely on the Fourier transform. This has been important in my past research<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and I hope that this can help you too.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2" id="integral-transforms">Integral transforms</h2>
<p>A large category of filtering techniques are based on <em>integral transforms</em>. Broadly speaking, an integral transform <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is an operation that is performed on a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and builds a function <span class="math inline">\(T\left[ f\right]\)</span> which is defined on a variable <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    T\left[ f \right](s) = \int dt ~ f(t) \cdot K(t, s)
\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (for kernel) is a function which “selects” which parts of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> are important as a fixed <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Note that for an integral transform to be useful as a filter, we’ll need the ability to invert the transformation, i.e. there exists an inverse kernel <span class="math inline">\(K^{-1}(s, t)\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    f(t) = \int ds ~ \left( T \left[ f\right] (s) \right) \cdot K^{-1}(s,t)
\]</span></p>
<p>All of this was very abstract, so let’s look at a concrete example: the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is an integral transform where<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{align}
        K(t, \omega)      &amp;\equiv \frac{e^{-i \omega t}}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}\\
        K^{-1}(\omega, t) &amp;\equiv  e^{i \omega t}\\
        \omega            &amp; \in \mathbb{R}
    \end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>There are many other integral transforms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Laplace transform (<span class="math inline">\(K(t, s) \equiv e^{- s t}\)</span>) which is useful to solve linear ordinary differential equations;</li>
<li>The Legendre transforms (<span class="math inline">\(K_n(t, s) \equiv P_n(s)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P_n\)</span> is the n<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials">Legendre polynomial</a>) which is used to solve for electron motion in hydrogen atoms;</li>
<li>The Radon transform (for which I cannot write down a kernel) which is used to analyze <a href="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/transform/plot_radon_transform.html">computed tomography data</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why are integral transforms interesting? Well, depending on the function <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> you want to transform, you might end up with a representation of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in the transformed space, <span class="math inline">\(T \left[ f\right] (s)\)</span>, which has nice properties! Re-using the Fourier transform for a simple, consider a function made up of two well-defined frequencies:
<span class="math display">\[
    f(t) \equiv e^{-i ~ 2t} + e^{-i ~ 5t}
\]</span>
The representation of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> in frequency space – the Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F\left[ f\right](\omega)\)</span> – is very simple:
<span class="math display">\[
    F\left[ f\right](\omega) = \sqrt{2 \pi} \left[ \delta(\omega - 2) + \delta(\omega - 5) \right]
\]</span>
The Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is perfectly localized in frequency space, being zero everywhere except at <span class="math inline">\(\omega=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\omega=5\)</span>. Functions composed of infinite waves (like the example above) always have the nice property of being localized in frequency space, which makes it easy to manipulate them… like filtering some of their components away!</p>
<h3 class="title is-3" id="discretization">Discretization</h3>
<p>It is much more efficient to use discretized versions of integral transforms on computers. Loosely speaking, given a discrete signal composed of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> terms <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(x_{N-1}\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
    T\left[ f \right](k) = \sum_n x_n \cdot K(n, k)
\]</span>
i.e. the integral is now a finite sum. For example, the discrete Fourier transform of the signal <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span>, can be written as:
<span class="math display">\[
    X_k = \sum_n x_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k n / N}
\]</span>
and its inverse becomes:
<span class="math display">\[
    x_n = \frac{1}{N}\sum_k X_k \cdot e^{i 2 \pi k n / N}
\]</span>
This is the definition used by <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.fft.html#module-numpy.fft">numpy</a>, for example. Let’s use this definition to compute the discrete Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(f(t) \equiv e^{-i ~ 2t} + e^{-i ~ 5t}\)</span>:</p>

<h2 class="title is-2" id="using-the-discrete-fourier-transform-to-filter-noise">Using the discrete Fourier transform to filter noise</h2>
<p>Let’s add some noise to our signal and see how we can use the discrete Fourier transform to filter it away. The discrete Fourier transform is most effective if your noise has some nice properties in frequency space. For example, consider high-frequency noise:
<span class="math display">\[
    N(t) = \sum_{\omega=20}^{50} \sin(\omega t + \phi_{\omega})
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_\omega\)</span> are random phases, one for each frequency component of the noise. While the signal looks very noisy, it’s very obvious in frequency-space what is noise and what is signal:</p>
<figure>
<img src="generated/pandocplot4482781002630889888.png" class="python image" alt="Top: Noisy signal (red) with the pure signal shown in comparison. Bottom: Discrete Fourier transform of the noisy signal shows that noise is confined to a specific region of frequency space. (Source code)" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Top</strong>: Noisy signal (red) with the pure signal shown in comparison. <strong>Bottom</strong>: Discrete Fourier transform of the noisy signal shows that noise is confined to a specific region of frequency space. (<a href="generated/pandocplot4482781002630889888.src.html">Source code</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basics of filtering is as follows: set the transform of a signal to 0 in regions which are thought to be undesirable. In the case of the Fourier transform, this is known as a <em>band-pass filter</em>; frequency components of a particular frequency <em>band</em> are passed-through unchanged, and frequency components outside of this band are zeroed. Special names are given to band-pass filters with no lower bound (low-pass filter) and no upper bound (high-pass filter). We can express this filtering as a window function <span class="math inline">\(W_k\)</span> in the inverse discrete Fourier transform:
<span class="math display">\[
    x_{n}^{\text{filtered}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_k W_k \cdot X_k \cdot e^{i 2 \pi k n / N}
\]</span>
In the case of the plot above, we want to apply a low-pass filter with a cutoff at <span class="math inline">\(\omega=10\)</span>. That is:
<span class="math display">\[
W_k = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
    1 &amp; : \ |k| \leq 10 \\
    0 &amp; : \ |k| &gt; 10
\end{array} \right.
\]</span>

<p>The lesson here is that filtering signals using a discretized integral transform (like the discrete Fourier transform) consists in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Performing a forward transform;</li>
<li>Modifying the transformed signal using a window function, usually by zeroing components;</li>
<li>Performing the inverse transform on the modified signal.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="title is-2" id="discrete-wavelet-transforms">Discrete wavelet transforms</h2>
<p>Discrete wavelet transforms are a class of discrete transforms which decomposes signals into a sum of wavelets. While the complex exponential functions which make up the Fourier transform are localized in frequency but infinite in space, wavelets are localized in both time space and frequency space.</p>
<p>In order to generate the basis wavelets, the original wavelet is stretched. This is akin to the Fourier transform, where the sine/cosine basis functions are ‘stretched’ by decreasing their frequency. In technical terms, the amount of ‘stretch’ is called the <strong>level</strong>. For example, the discrete wavelet transform using the <code>db4</code><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> wavelet up to level 5 is the decomposition of a signal into the following wavelets:</p>

</figure>
<p>In practice, discrete wavelet transforms are expressed as two transforms per level. This means that a discrete wavelet transform of level 1 gives back two sets of coefficients. One set of coefficient contains the low-frequency components of the signal, and are usually called the <em>approximate coefficients</em>. The other set of coefficients contains the high-frequency components of the signal, and are usually called the <em>detail coefficients</em>. A wavelet transform of level 2 is done by taking the approximate coefficients of level 1, and transforming them using a stretched wavelet into two sets of coefficients: the approximate coefficients of level 2, and the detail coefficients of level 2. Therefore, a signal transformed using a wavelet transform of level <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> sets of coefficients: the approximate and detail coefficients of level <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, and the detail coefficients of levels <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N-2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2" id="filtering-using-the-discrete-wavelet-transform">Filtering using the discrete wavelet transform</h2>
<p>The discrete Fourier transform excels at filtering away noise which has nice properties in frequency space. This is isn’t always the case in practice; for example, noise may have frequency components which overlap with the signal we’re looking for. This was the case in my research on ultrafast electron diffraction of polycrystalline samples<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, where the ‘noise’ was a trendline which moved over time, and whose frequency components overlapped with diffraction pattern we were trying to isolate.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s use <a href="../files/wavelet-filter/diffraction.csv">real diffraction data</a> and we’ll pretend this is a time signal, to keep the units familiar. We’ll take a look at some really annoying noise: normally-distributed white noise drawn from this distribution<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>:
<span class="math display">\[
    P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp{-\frac{(x + 1/2)^2}{2}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Visually:</p>

<p>This example shows a common situation: realistic noise whose frequency components overlap with the signal we’re trying to isolate. We wouldn’t be able to use filtering techniques based on the Fourier transform.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a particular discrete wavelet transform, with the underlying wavelet <code>sym17</code>. Decomposing the noisy signal up to level 3, we get four components:</p>

</figure>
<p>Looks like the approximate coefficients at level 3 contain all the information we’re looking for. Let’s set all detail coefficients to 0, and invert the transform:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"> (<a href="generated/pandocplot11165045477663619147.src.html">Source code</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That’s looking pretty good! Not perfect of course, which I expected because we’re using real data here.</p>
<h2 class="title is-2" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, I’ve tried to give some of the intuition behind filtering signals using discrete wavelet transforms as an analogy to filtering with the discrete Fourier transform.</p>
<p>This was only a basic explanation. There is so much more to wavelet transforms. There are many classes of wavelets with different properties, some of which<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> are very useful when dealing with higher-dimensional data (e.g. images and videos). If you’re dealing with noisy data, it won’t hurt to try and see if wavelets will help you understand it!</p>
